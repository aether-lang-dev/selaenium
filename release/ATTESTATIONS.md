# Attestations — cross-built engine artifacts run on real target hardware

Each record: a SHA256-identified artifact that was cross-built on one host and
verified on its actual target OS. A verifier re-hashes the artifact they hold,
matches `sha256`, and trusts the recorded result for those exact bytes. Format
per release/README.md.

target=macos-amd64  host=Intel iMac (macOS 15.7, x86_64)  date=2026-09-01
built-on=ChromeOS/Linux dev box via 'ae build --target=x86_64-macos' (zig cc) — NO native build on the Mac
coverage=ffi+live-local-chrome
result=PASS
suite=C dlopen harness: dlopen + 48 exports (nm -gU) + newSession/get/getTitle/findElement(By.id)/quit against headless Chrome-for-Testing 138 via chromedriver 138
notes=chromedriver 138.0.7204.183 mac-x64; engine driver-resolver (ensure_driver) is Linux-only so Chrome/chromedriver were placed manually; no HTTPS-Grid tested (Tier-2 pure-TLS not wired); the .dylib crossed over as a finished Mach-O — only the trivial test harness was compiled on the Mac
